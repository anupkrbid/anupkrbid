        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>
          It's my pleasure to introduce myself, well, I'm Anup Kumar Bid, born
          in Bhubaneswar and raised in Kolkata.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have done my schooling in Grace Ling Liang English School then
          pursued my final year B.Tech from Techno India Batanagr.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are three in my family. My father is a business man and my mother
          is a homemaker.
        </p>
        <p>
          My greatest strength are I'm a fast learner, smart and hard worker. I
          take both success and failure in a balanced manner. My greatest
          weakness are my love for food, but I'm trying to overcome that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only reason why I wanted Computers to be my profession was my love
          for it. Back in my school days I was fascinated about new technologies
          and specially computers. This is the reason why I opted computers to
          be my profession. I Love Coding and always try to find various ways of
          solving the same problem. I always try and find easy solutions to
          complex problems. Although being an introvert but I never shy to put
          forward my opinion. Often while doing my work I forget to eat or even
          sleep. This is my biggest strength as it is my weakness. My ethic is
          "I never neglect an opportunity for my improvement".
