        <h1>Why am I here?</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Anup Kumar Bid. I am a self-motivated Frontend Engineer
          with 4+ years of experience in building scalable web applications that
          drastically improve efficiency and customer experience, proving the
          ability to learn fast and work under pressure by taking complete
          ownership of the assigned tasks. Spearheaded successful transition of
          a mission-critical microservice from Laravel/PHP to Node.js which cut
          wait times by 60%. Seeking to further improve my skills in the future
          as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though I have been working with frontend technologies for so long
          I mostly work with javascript side of things and I have never been
          properly able to learn CSS. I have seen students from here sharing
          what they learn on linkedin and it's truely inspiring. I would love to
          see myself being able to do that too. I feel I'm a good engineer but
          there are things that am exepected to know but I don't, so my purpose
          for applying for neog camp is to polish my existing skill and learn
          the skills that I lack.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also seen that React is in high demand and since I have worked
          extensively with Angular I would also love to add react to proficiency
          list.
