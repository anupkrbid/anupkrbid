        <h1>Why am I here?</h1>
        <p>
          Even though I have been working with frontend technologies for so long
          I mostly work with javascript side of things and I have never been
          properly able to learn CSS. I have seen students from here sharing
          what they learn on linkedin and it's truely inspiring. I would love to
          see myself being able to do that too. I feel I'm a good engineer but
          there are things that am exepected to know but I don't, so my purpose
          for applying for neog camp is to polish my existing skill and learn
          the skills that I lack.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also seen that React is in high demand and since I have worked
          extensively with Angular I would also love to add react to proficiency
          list.
